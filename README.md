# Protect data on LinuxONE With Pervasive Encryption
Protect your data on data LinuxONE using pervasive encryption with nearly no CPU overhead.

In this Code Pattern, you will build and deploy a crypto dashboard with IBM Cloud private running in the LinuxONE Community Cloud.

IBM Cloud Private is a private cloud platform for developing and running workloads locally. It is an integrated environment that enables you to design, develop, deploy and manage on-premises, containerized cloud applications behind a firewall. It includes the container orchestrator Kubernetes, a private image repository, a management console and monitoring frameworks.

When you will complete this Code Pattern, you will understand how to:
* Configure a LinuxONE Linux guest to use the hardware cryptographic acceleration.
* Use the LinuxONE crypto APIS to get monitoring data about hardware cryptographic use.
* Build a Docker image from an existing application.
* Deploy a Docker image to IBM Cloud Private.
* Run the existing application using the IBM Cloud Private catalog.
* Build an ELK Dashboard to monitor hardware cryptographic activity of LinuxONE Linux guest.

# Architecture
In this Code Pattern, the following key architecture components are required:
* A Linux Virtual Machine provisionned in the IBM LinuxONE Community cloud
* A Canonical Ubuntu 16.04.LTS (or later) Linux Virtual Machine

1. User to create first a Linux Virtual Machine on LinuxONE.
2. User to configure the Linux cryptostack in order to benefit the hardware cryptographic acceleration.
3. User to deploy and ELK stack on IBM Cloud private.
3. User to use a script in order to collect thanks to Linux crypto APIs.
4. User to create crypto dashboard thanks to ELK.
